SALEM: Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Monday wondered whether Union home minister Amit Shah is angry with Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he (Shah) had said there was a chance for a Tamilian to become the PM candidate.

"Either Tamilisai or L Murugan may have that chance,” Stalin said while speaking to reporters in Mettur.

On Sunday, during a closed door meeting with South Chennai district party functionaries, Amit Shah said it  no Tamils got a chance to become the PM.

The chief minister said Shah had not given a direct reply to his demand that the Centre list out projects and schemes implemented for Tamil Nadu. But the home minister had just replied that the BJP government had allotted more than four-fold of the funds allotted by the Congress government, Stalin said, adding, “So he hasn’t given me a direct reply.”
